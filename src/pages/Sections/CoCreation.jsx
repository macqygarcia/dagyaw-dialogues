              One of the key tenets of Dagyaw is its commitment to follow a
              Co-Creation process that involves bringing in stakeholders from
              across multiple sectors to collectively develop and produce
              mutually shared governance outcome/s from the virtual town hall
              sessions.{" "}
            </p>
            <p>
              As such, representatives from the non-government sector shall be
              invited to be co-equal partners and participate from the planning
              stage up to the rollout of the townhalls.
